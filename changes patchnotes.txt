Simpler Times is a mod I made to vent, just wanting to see some Nomai structures in the game fixed and prettied up, starting with the Orbital Probe Cannon. Finishing that rather quickly, returning the Probe Tracking Module to the cannon made me wonder about maybe going a little further and making a mod that just fixed up a bunch of broken things - and by extension, made a more casual, new game plus version of the game.

It also does away with the timed elements on Brittle Hollow and to an extent, on the Hourglass Twins - so if you struggled with those this might help, but really the point was to present a prettier version of the world, so I'd suggest another mod to help out unless you're feeling done with the game already.


* Volcanic weather has calmed on Brittle Hollow

The Hanging City's vertical gravity highway has been fixed
Gravity pathway up to the Tower of Quantum Knowledge has been fixed
Added a tractor beam controller to enter/exit the Hanging City from the north pole surface



* Ancient lakes on the Hourglass Twins have resurfaced and washed away its sand

Removed overgrown cacti blocking lower Sunless City entrance from Gravity Cannon
Added a light source to the fossil fish's lure
Fixed a broken roof on a tower on Ash Twin
Holes in a tower's floors have been patched up
Sun Station catwalk now remains intact to walk on



* Orbital Probe Cannon now remains intact and no longer loses one of its modules (note: disregard a certain Nomai computer diagram)
Added a Hearthian flag to the core of a planet

* Several broken, one-way rotating doors have been fixed
