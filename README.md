## ABOUT

Simpler Times is a mod I made to vent, just wanting to see if I could fix up some key Nomai structures in the game.

I started with rebuilding the Orbital Probe Cannon - and finishing that made me wonder about maybe going a little further and making a mod that just fixed up a bunch of broken things. Doing this unintentionally trivialized several puzzles in the game, which I decided to further lean into by indulgently seeing if I could remove as many timed mechanics as possible, whether for accessibility's sake or for logical sense.

This mod essentially is a new-game-plus that presents a prettier and calmer version of the world.
However, in that endeavour: ***crucial mechanics are disabled, and many critical areas are made trivially accessible by this mod*** - so if you have not yet finished playing the game, this is probably not the mod for you!

But for everyone else returning to this universe: I hope this mod will show you some simpler times of this beautiful world!
