## ABOUT

Simpler Times is a mod I made to vent, just wanting to see some Nomai structures in the game fixed and prettied up.

Starting with rebuilding the Orbital Probe Cannon, returning a module to the cannon made me wonder about maybe going a little further and making a mod that just fixed up a bunch of broken things - and by extension, made a more casual, new game plus version of the game.

This mod also does away with the timed elements on Brittle Hollow, and to an extent, on the Hourglass Twins - so if you struggled with those and are for some reason, surfing the mod list without having finished the game, this mod could help.
But ***several critical things are made trivially accessible by this mod*** since the point was to present a prettier, more logically accessible version of the world - so I'd suggest finding another mod to help out your journey!

..Uuunless you're feeling straight-up done with the game already - in which case, I hope this mod will help give you a simpler time exploring and enjoying this beautiful world!
