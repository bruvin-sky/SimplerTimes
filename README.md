## ABOUT

Simpler Times is a mod I made to vent, just wanting to see some Nomai structures in the game fixed and prettied up.

Starting with rebuilding the Orbital Probe Cannon, returning a module to the cannon made me wonder about maybe going a little further and making a mod that just fixed up a bunch of broken things - and by extension, made a more casual, new game plus version of the game.

This mod does away with most timed elements in the star system and some elements that may have made the game stressful with the goal of making it more accessible.
But ***several critical things are made trivially accessible by this mod*** since the point was to present a prettier, more logically accessible version of the world - so I'd suggest finding another mod to help out your journey!

..Uuunless you're feeling straight-up done with the game already - in which case, I hope this mod will help give you a simpler time exploring and enjoying this beautiful world!
